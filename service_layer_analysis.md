Let's structure the service/factory layer to handle our data extraction and creation needs:

1. `MatchFactory`

- Creates base Match objects from common match data
- Determines if a match is a fixture or played match
- Delegates to specialized factories

2. `FixtureMatchFactory` (uses MatchFactory)

- Creates FixtureMatch objects
- Coordinates with other services to get form and H2H data
- Fields: match basics + form + H2H

3. `PlayedMatchFactory` (uses MatchFactory)

- Creates PlayedMatch objects
- Coordinates with MatchStatisticsService
- Fields: match basics + statistics

4. `TeamFactory`

- Creates Team objects
- Handles team basic information extraction
- Manages team identifier consistency

5. `TeamFormService`

- Extracts last k matches for a team
- Uses PlayedMatchFactory for each historical match
- Builds TeamForm objects
- Handles form period calculations

6. `HeadToHeadService`

- Extracts historical matches between two teams
- Uses PlayedMatchFactory for each H2H match
- Creates HeadToHead objects
- Manages the number of historical matches to extract

7. `MatchStatisticsService`

- Extracts detailed statistics from played matches
- Creates MatchStatistics objects
- Handles different statistic formats/types

8. `DataExtractionCoordinator`

- Orchestrates the overall extraction process
- Manages dependencies between services
- Handles rate limiting
- Error handling and retry logic

9. `JsonSerializationService`

- Handles serialization of all objects to JSON
- Manages relationships in JSON structure
- Handles date/time formatting
- File writing operations

Support Services:

1. `RateLimitingService`

- Manages request rates to Flashscore
- Implements delays and queuing

2. `CacheService`

- Caches frequently accessed data
- Reduces duplicate requests

3. `ValidationService`

- Validates extracted data
- Ensures data consistency
- Verifies relationships

Workflow Example:

```
DataExtractionCoordinator
  → FixtureMatchFactory
    → MatchFactory (base match data)
    → TeamFactory (for both teams)
    → TeamFormService (for both teams)
      → PlayedMatchFactory (for form matches)
        → MatchStatisticsService
    → HeadToHeadService
      → PlayedMatchFactory (for H2H matches)
        → MatchStatisticsService
  → JsonSerializationService
```

Key Features:

1. Clear separation of concerns
2. Service dependencies clearly defined
3. Each service has a single responsibility
4. Easy to implement caching at various levels
5. Flexible for adding new data types
6. Error handling can be implemented at each level
7. Easy to add logging/monitoring
